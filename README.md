Upload of an HTML5 Canvas game made 2020.

The development did not get very far before it stopped.

The game concept is based on the Club penguin snow ninja mini-game, where the characters are restrained to tiles with specific movement and attack patterns. Allied and enemy characters possess different elements (grass, water, fire etc.) that gives that certain abilities. Movement and attack patterns, movement and attack cooldown, attack damage, health, and special moves differ. The point of the game is simpply to defeat the enemy by strategic movement, attacks and use of the different characters abilities and drawbacks.

The sprites (characters and obstacles) are made by me.
